# Blinking-of-Alternate-LEDs-using-8051-Microcontroller
# Description
This project implements the blinking of two alternate LEDs using an 8051 microcontroller. The LEDs are connected to different GPIO pins, and they blink alternately, one turning ON while the other turns OFF, and vice versa. The program is written in Embedded C and is simulated using Proteus.The primary aim of the project is to demonstrate how to control multiple GPIO pins on the 8051 microcontroller, using simple logic to alternate between the LEDs. It provides a hands-on understanding of basic microcontroller operation, GPIO control, and timing using delay loops.
# Features:
Microcontroller Used: 8051 (AT89C51 or equivalent)
Programming Language: Embedded C
Simulation Software: Proteus
# How it Works:
LED1 is connected to P2.0 and LED2 is connected to P2.1 of the 8051 microcontroller.
The microcontroller alternates the state of both GPIO pins, turning one LED ON while turning the other OFF.
A delay function is used between the switching to control the blinking rate.
# Simulation:
The project is simulated in Proteus, where the circuit, including the 8051 microcontroller and the LEDs, is virtually represented to verify the alternate blinking without physical hardware.
